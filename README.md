# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_Streamlit_APP
*View Project* : https://multiple-disease-prediction-app-0510.streamlit.app/

Multiple Disease Prediction System, a machine learning-powered application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user-provided data. The project is implemented in Python and deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

*Features*
-Predicts the risk of multiple diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.
-User-friendly web interface for easy data input and result visualization.
-Pre-trained machine learning models ensure accurate predictions.
